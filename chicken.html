    <h1>Pig</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>pig</b>(Sus domesticus), often called swine, hog, or domestic pig when distinguishing from other members
        of the genus Sus, is an omnivorous, domesticated, even-toed, hoofed mammal.
        It is variously considered a subspecies of Sus scrofa (the wild boar or Eurasian boar) or a distinct species.
        The pig's head-plus-body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft), and adult pigs typically weigh between 50
        and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb), with well-fed individuals even exceeding this range.
        The size and weight of hogs largely depends on their breed. Compared to other artiodactyls, a pig's head is
        relatively long and pointed.
        Most even-toed ungulates are herbivorous, but pigs are omnivores, like their wild relative. Pigs grunt and make
        snorting sounds.

        When used as livestock, pigs are farmed primarily for the production of meat, called pork.
        A group of pigs is called a passel, a team, or a sounder.
        The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in products.
        Pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.
